13,"an old bald man named alderson awakens and is bewildered to find himself in a cube-shaped room with a hatch in each wall, on the floor and in the ceiling. opening some of the hatches, he finds passages to rooms that are identical except for their colors. he enters one room  and, without warning, is sliced to pieces by a wire grid. in another such room, five people - quentin, worth, holloway, rennes and leaven - meet. none know where they are, how they got there, or why. quentin informs them that some cubes contain traps ; assuming they are triggered by motion detectors, rennes tests each by throwing a boot in first. leaven notices numbers inscribed in the passageways between rooms. quentin, a policeman, recognizes ""the wren"" as an escape artist renowned for getting out of jails. after ""booting"" one room, rennes enters but is sprayed by acid, which eats through his face and kills him. quentin believes each person has a reason for being there. he is a police officer, leaven is a mathematics student, holloway a doctor and conspiracy theorist who thinks the ""military industrial complex"" is responsible, while the surly worth declines to talk about himself or his past actions. leaven theorizes that any room marked with a prime number is a trap. they then find a mentally challenged man named kazan, whom holloway insists they bring along. quentin enters a supposedly safe room and is nearly killed by a razor-wire trap, disproving leaven's theory. tensions rise, with quentin becoming irritated by holloway's paranoia and liberalism, kazan's childlike mentality, and worth's reticence. he baits worth into revealing of himself. he then admits that he knows about this place, as he designed the cube's outher shell. worth insists that he knows nothing about the rest of the structure. he believes that its purpose has been lost over time and that they are only there because not using it would mean admitting the cube was a waste. his knowledge of the outer shell's size allows leaven to determine that there are 26 rooms to a side, 17,576 in all. she guesses that the numbers indicate the cartesian coordinates of the rooms. the group starts moving toward the nearest edge. they arrive close to the edge, but find that each neighbouring room is trapped. rather than backtrack, they decide to make their way silently through a blue colored room whose trap is sound-activated . the others manage to pass, but when quentin goes up, kazan makes a noise, and he is almost impaled by the spikes, storming and almost beating kazan up. they arrive at an edge room and find a wide, unlit gap between it and the outer shell. holloway swings out to investigate, using a rope made from their clothes, but nearly falls when the cube suddenly shakes; she climbs up and grabs quentin's arm, but he drops her to her death, telling the others that she slipped, now dellusioned and paranoid from the cube's actions. as they rest, quentin tries to persuade leaven to abandon the others and come with him. he quickly becomes aggressive. when worth intervenes, quentin beats him and then throws him through the floor hatch. worth laughs hysterically at what he finds — rennes' corpse. the thought that they have been going around in circles is demoralizing, but then leaven realizes that the rooms move about periodically. leaven deduces that traps are not tagged by prime numbers but by powers of prime numbers. kazan, it turns out, is an autistic savant who can quickly do prime factorizations and thus identify the traps. leaven determines that the numbers indicate the positions that each room will reach as it cycles through the cube. the room that connects to the ""bridge"" leading to the only door in the outer shell proves to be the one in which the group first woke up. the alignment they need will come in two moves. worth ambushes quentin and leaves him behind during one move as they hurry to the cube adjoining the bridge. when they open the hatch, they are met by a bright white light . worth decides to stay over leaven's objections, saying there is nothing outside for him but ""boundless human stupidity."" a bloodied quentin appears and fatally stabs first leaven, then worth with a door handle, before going after kazan. with the last of his strength, worth grabs quentin's leg, holding him long enough for quentin to be ripped apart in the passageway as the bridge shifts. worth then dies of his wounds, and kazan walks out into the bright light."

including sergeant jake roenick , veteran officer jasper , secretary iris , and psychiatrist alex . roenick is haunted by a botched undercover operation from eight months before that resulted in the death of the other two members of his team. meanwhile, crime lord marion bishop  is arrested after a confrontation results in the death of an undercover officer. bishop is put on a prison bus with three other criminals: addict beck , petty crook anna , and counterfeiter smiley . a raging snowstorm and treacherous road conditions force the bus driver to make a detour to precinct 13, where the prisoners are to be held until the storm is over. new year's celebrations at the precinct are soon cut short, however, as an intrusion by masked gunmen results in the death of one of the prison guards, and fatally injures the other. the officers soon find they are surrounded by unknown assailants, preparing to lay siege to the precinct. cellular phone reception has been jammed, as well as any radio communication. after one of the attackers throws a brick into the precinct with ""bishop"" written on it, jasper claims they are bishop's men, here to extract him. this is proven to be false, however, after roenick kills one of the attackers in another assault and reclaims the man's wallet, which contained his police badge. bishop then reveals the attackers are actually policemen, led by corrupt captain marcus duvall . previously, bishop and duvall were partners in crime, but duvall got greedy. now he and his men, including mike kahane , are to kill bishop before he can testify at trial, saving all officers involved a hefty prison sentence. however, now that everyone inside precinct 13 knows of the true plot instead of just bishop, they are all a liability and must be eliminated. heavily outnumbered by a growing police force made up of street cops, snipers, and elite swat troopers, roenick makes the decision to free and arm the prisoners to help them hold out until dawn. although the officers do not trust the criminals, and vice-versa, roenick and bishop reach an agreement to cooperate in order to stand a chance to survive the night. with their combined efforts,

escape over a nearby fence. as the prison bus explodes and they notice smiley and beck escaping, they decide to use this as a distraction and also plan an escape, making use of capra's car in order for a couple people to flee the precinct and call for help while the police are busy with beck and smiley. anna, who can hotwire a car, volunteers to go. alex also goes along. beck and smiley make it to the perimeter fence before they are killed by snipers. anna and alex appear to have made it, before a cop hidden in the backseat shoots and kills anna, causing the car to crash and alex to be captured. alex is brought before duvall, who asks her how many are in the precinct. defiant, she replies ""a hundred"", and she is executed by duvall after complimenting her on her bravery. with only

42,"at a psychiatric hospital, former chief inspector charles dreyfus  is largely recovered from the murderous insanity that saw him repeatedly attempt to kill the thorn in his side, inspector jacques clouseau. he is about to be released but clouseau , who is now chief inspector and has arrived to speak on dreyfus's behalf, comes to visit, and his clumsiness and proneness to accidents drive dreyfus insane again. soon thereafter, dreyfus escapes from the asylum, intent on killing clouseau. his first attempt involves planting a bomb whilst clouseau destructively duels with his manservant cato , who is under orders, from clouseau, to keep clouseau alert by randomly attacking him. the bomb merely destroys clouseau's apartment whilst clouseau himself is unharmed, largely because clouseau has been distracted by an inflatable costume and a telephone call by dreyfus which was meant to keep him in place for the bombing. cato, however, ends up in the hospital. dreyfus sets his sights higher. using his knowledge of the underworld, he enlists the help of an army of vicious criminals, kidnaps nuclear physicist professor hugo fassbender  and the professor's daughter margo , forcing the professor to build a ""doomsday weapon"" in return for his daughter's freedom. as hugo fassbender cannot bear to hear his daughter undergoing dreyfus's torture , he agrees. clouseau travels to england to investigate fassbender's disappearance, with typically chaotic results, as scotland yard section director alec drummond  and superintendent quinlan  painfully learn. however, clouseau manages to set his sights on jarvis, the cross-dressing butler of the fassbenders, and while jarvis is killed by the kidnappers, to whom he had become a dangerous witness, clouseau follows a clue found on the crime scene to the oktoberfest in germany. meanwhile dreyfus broadcasts himself to the world to announce his ultimatum. disintegrating the united nations headquarters in new york city before the disbelieving eyes of the world, he blackmails the leaders of the world, including the president of the united states , into assassinating clouseau. forced to take dreyfus's threat seriously, several nations send assassins to kill clouseau at the oktoberfest. many of the nations, however, instruct their assassins to kill other assassins if necessary in order to ensure that their own country can kill clouseau and thus win dreyfus's favor and possibly get hold of the doomsday machine themselves. this, combined with clouseau's typical bumbling fashion, enables clouseau to evade each assassination attempt just as it is about to happen, so that the assassins all kill each other instead. in the end, only the operatives of egypt and russia remain alive. the egyptian assassin , sneaking into clouseau's hotel room, shoots a man he believes to be clouseau . the russian operative, olga bariosova , who has sneaked into clouseau's room, seduces the egyptian, similarly mistaking him for clouseau. his passionate sexuality convinces her not to assassinate him; when the real clouseau makes an appearance, he is surprised to discover a beautiful woman in his bed who confuses him further by declaring her undying passion for him, and by finding a dead man in his bath. a tattoo on the dead man, combined with olga's dismissively revealed knowledge, reveals to clouseau dreyfus's location at a castle in bavaria. he leaves immediately leaving a confused and frustrated olga behind him. dreyfus is elated at clouseau's apparent demise, but his joy is soured by a bad case of toothache. clouseau, who has arrived in the village near dreyfus's castle but has been denied entry into the castle by a mischievous drawbridge, eventually infiltrates dreyfus's castle hideout disguised as a dentist, intoxicates dreyfus  with nitrous oxide, and pulls one of dreyfus's healthy teeth. realising the deception, dreyfus orders clouseau killed, but clouseau escapes. enraged, dreyfus means to seek vengeance on the world by destroying england;

51,"{{plot}} the documentary details the ambitious journey of an early social distortion and youth brigade and a small road crew as they tour across the u.s. and canada. the story begins with a hopeful shawn stern relating his big ideas about the tour and what he wants to accomplish, stating that the bus should hold up as the group gets to work fixing up the bus. in fact, much of the plot revolves around the bus breaking down in three or four states. the road crew manager, monk, is the only one who seems to know how to fix the bus so he becomes instrumental in keeping the tour alive. as the tour begins, the bands head north up through san francisco, oregon, and seattle. the film includes live footage of social distortion doing a then written but not yet recorded, ""mommy's little monster,"" as well as the creativity of mike ness writing the song, ""another state of mind,"" for which the film was named. one memorable clip shows mike ness getting ready for a show, giving his explanation of his ""look"" – why he does his hair the way he does and why he wears eye makeup when most guys don't. from seattle they continue on up through canada from where the stern brothers have citizenship. the last leg of the trip includes big us cities like detroit, chicago, washington, d.c. and new york. at the time this film was made, there was much misinformation and discrimination regarding punks, so a lot of the film is aimed at explaining this counter-culture by interviewing local kids at each tour destination as well as a few so-cal punks whose commentary appears periodically during the documentary. at one point during the trip, the group arrives at a venue where they had a show booked and go out of their way to avoid discrimination by climbing up a fire escape and going in the back door in order to avoid the huge biker-looking men in the front of the club. they describe what probably would happen if they went in the front door - they would be intimidated, yelled at and maybe beaten up as they walked through the door and through the club so they find it easier to avoid the whole scene. on another occasion, the starving group heads to a cafe in montreal after a show to get something to eat and find the waitress will hardly look at them, let alone serve them. she is apparently frightened or annoyed by them based purely on their appearance. the woman calls the police to have them removed from the restaurant with no provocation . as the tour proceeds, there is much discussion about the issues young adults face such as being misunderstood, the push and pull of parents, rules, drugs, violence and alcohol. one of the more interesting facets of this film is the fact that no matter where the group goes across the country and canada, the locals seem to be dealing with the same issues. the punk movement was revolutionary and a bit scary to the older generations at that time who had never really seen anything like them before. somewhere around the second or third bus break-down, between canada and chicago, the reality of their trip begins to sink in. 11 or 12 guys on a small, now reeking, constantly breaking down bus is not as much fun as they had first anticipated. their per diem has been slashed from $10 a day to $5 as a result of money having to be spent on fixing the old bus and they seem to keep getting ripped off by the club owners. one classic moment from the film comes when mark stern holds up some rolls of pennies he was paid with by one cheap san francisco club owner  nearing the end of the trip, some of the road crew leave the trip early, leaving the band members to set up and fend for themselves. everyone starts to get on each other's nerves out of hunger, frustration and cabin fever and begin to act out in different ways. roadie, mike brinson, is shown constantly dyeing his hair different colors based on his mood which begins with a happy pink, turns green and eventually a dismal black. mike ness, usually placated by the beer which they somehow always found the money for, lets out a little frustration one night at a small impromptu show, breaking out in a frenzied, seizure-looking rendition of the worm during his performance. a final bus break-down in d.c. causes the group to split up. brinson, liles and danell abandon the group to stay with friends of brinson's, where they voice their exhaustion with the tour and the rest of the group. out of desperation, the others go to the local kmart to shop for tarps with the members of minor threat. an interview allows ian mackaye to detail a bit of his straight edge, which the so-cal group doesn't really buy into but seems to admire. this final break-down becomes the proverbial straw that broke the tours' back. mike ness ends up being stranded when the rest of social distortion heads back to oc where they feel they have a better chance of making money rather than staying on the difficult tour. ness has really no choice but to grab a flight back to la himself and try to regroup. with the headliner off the tour, youth brigade decides to throw in the towel as well. they all climb into the film crew's equipment truck and head back to california. the film closes with an interview of shawn stern reflecting back on the tour. when asked if he thought it was worth it, he responds, ""yeah, i'd say it was worth it."""

123,"it is christmas 1911 and arthur winslow, a retired london banker, is making final preparations for a dinner to seal the engagement between his daughter catherine, an outspoken supporter of the controversial cause of women's suffrage, and captain john watherstone. the family and guests are toasting the upcoming marriage when arthur discovers that his youngest son ronnie, a 13-year old cadet at the royal naval college at osbourne, is unexpectedly home. ronnie has been accused of the theft of a postal order. an internal enquiry, conducted without notice to his family and without benefit of representation, finds him guilty and mr. winslow is ""requested to withdraw"" his son from the college . ronnie proclaims his innocence and his father believes him—enough so that he demands an apology from the college. when the college refuses to reinstate ronnie, arthur decides to take the matter to court. with the help of his daughter and desmond curry, a solicitor and friend of the family, mr. winslow decides to hire the most highly sought after barrister in england at the time, sir robert morton, known also to be a shrewd opposition member of parliament. the government is unwilling to allow the case to proceed. the naval college is a representative of the admiralty and the crown, and as such british law presumes they are infallible and above question; their judgment can be legally questioned only with the permission of the attorney general. however, after heated debates in the house of commons, the government yields, and the case does come to court. catherine had expected sir robert to decline the case, or at best to treat it as a political tool; instead, he is coolly matter-of-fact about having been persuaded of ronnie's innocence by his responses to questioning  in the presence of his family. catherine, a left-wing suffragette, is not enthusiastic about morton, whom she considers cold and heartless. catherine is also disturbed by sir robert's establishment views: he is a conservative opponent of women’s suffrage. ""he always speaks out against what is right,"" she observes to her father, though she admires his legal skills. morton, for his part, obviously is quite taken with catherine from the moment he meets her in his offices; later he stares at her as she arrives at the house of commons and as she watches the proceedings from the ladies' gallery. in the meantime, the case creates media hysteria and puts a heavy toll on the winslow family – their funds are rapidly depleted in order to cover legal expenses. mr. winslow's physical health deteriorates under the strain and the happiness of the winslows' home is destroyed. arthur's wife, grace, begins to wonder if the real issue is justice or a father's stubborn and foolish pride. forced to make economical sacrifices, grace winslow is unwilling to take the drastic measure of dismissing violet, who has been the family’s maid for over twenty years. the eldest son, dickie winslow, has to leave oxford due to the lack of money destroying his chance at a career in the civil service. instead, he is compelled to find employment in his father’s bank. catherine's marriage settlement is also gone. her fiancé john watherstone breaks off the engagement in the face of opposition from his father , forcing her to consider a sincere and well-intentioned offer of marriage from desmond, whom she does not love. sir robert has also declined appointment as lord chief justice, rather than drop the case. the least affected is ronnie, who happily has been transferred to a new school. at trial, sir robert  is able to discredit much of the supposed evidence. the admiralty, certainly embarrassed and presumably no longer confident of ronnie's guilt, abruptly withdraws all charges against him, proclaiming the boy entirely innocent. when their resounding victory arrives, not a single member of the winslow’s family is present at court. it is violet, the maid, who tells mr. winslow and catherine what has happened at court. shortly after, sir robert appears in the winslows’ home to share the good news. the film ends with a suggestion that romance may yet blossom between sir robert and catherine, who acknowledges that she had misjudged him all along."

156," the film centers on the family of tevye , a jewish family living in the town of anatevka, in tsarist russia, in 1905. anatevka is broken into two sections: a small orthodox jewish section; and a larger russian orthodox christian section. tevye notes that, ""we don't bother them, and so far, they don't bother us."" throughout the film, tevye breaks the fourth wall by talking at times, directly to the audience or to the heavens , for the audience's benefit. much of the story is also told in musical form. tevye is not wealthy, despite working hard, like most jews in anatevka, also having many children. he and his wife, golde , have five daughters and cannot afford to give them much in the way of dowries. according to their tradition, they have to rely on the village matchmaker, yente , to find them husbands. life in the little town of anatevka is very hard and tevye speaks not only of the difficulties of being poor but also of the jewish community's constant fear of harassment from their non-jewish neighbors. in addition, tevye has a lame horse, that adds to the misery of being poor, and has to carry the wagon by himself.  the film opens with tevye explaining to the audience that what keeps the jews of anatevka going is the balance they achieve through following their ancient traditions. he also explains that the lot of the jews in russia is as precarious as a fiddler on a roof: trying to scratch out a pleasant tune, while not breaking their necks. the fiddler  appears throughout the film as a metaphoric reminder of the jews' ever-present fears and danger, and also as a symbol of the traditions tevye is trying to hold onto as his world changes around him. while in town, tevye meets perchik , a radical marxist from kiev. tevye invites perchik to stay with him and his family, and as a deal, offers him food, in exchange for perchik tutoring his daughters. through yente, tevye arranges a marriage for his oldest daughter, tzeitel , to lazar wolf , a wealthy butcher. however, tzeitel is in love with her childhood sweetheart, motel  kamzoil  the tailor, and begs her father not to make her marry the much older butcher. initially angry because he has already made an ""agreement"" with wolf, tevye realizes that tzeitel loves motel and yields to his daughter's demands. to get tzeitel and tevye out of the agreement with lazar, tevye claims to have a nightmare, which he repeats to golde. in the nightmare, he says that golde's deceased grandmother tzeitel  told him that tzeitel is supposed to marry motel, as it was decided in heaven. also in the nightmare, lazar wolf's late wife, fruma-sarah , warns tevye that if tzeitel marries lazar, she will kill tzeitel after three weeks of marriage. golde concludes that the dream was a message to be followed from their ancestors, and tzeitel and motel arrange to be married. meanwhile, after one of perchik's lessons with bielke and shprintze , tevye's second daughter, hodel ([[michele marsh  mocks perchik's interpretation of the story of leah he told her sisters. he, in turn, criticizes her for hanging on to the old traditions of her religion and tells her that the world is changing. to illustrate this, he dances with her, because the opposite sexes dancing together is considered forbidden to orthodox jews. the two are shown to be falling in love, and perchik tells hodel that they just changed an old tradition. the constable , is basically sympathetic to the jewish villagers, though not enough to give up his job in their defense. he resists when ordered to put on a ""spontaneous"" anti-jewish demonstration but gives in to keep his job. before tzeitel's wedding, he warns tevye of the impending demonstration. later, at tzeitel and motel's wedding, an argument breaks out over whether a girl should be able to choose her own husband. perchik addresses the crowd and says that, since they love each other, it should be left for the couple to decide and creates further controversy by asking hodel to dance with him. the two begin to dance, and gradually, the crowd warms to the idea — with tevye and golde joining, then motel and tzeitel. the wedding then proceeds with great joy. suddenly, the military presence in the town and the constable arrive and begin a pogrom, attacking the jews and their property. the constable stops the attack on the wedding celebration after the ""radical"" perchik is wounded in the scuffle with the tsar's men; however, he allows the pogrom to continue in the form of massive property damage to the village of anatevka.  a few months later, as perchik prepares to leave anatevka to work for the revolution, he proposes to hodel and she accepts. when they tell tevye, he is furious that they have decided to marry without his permission, and with perchik leaving anatevka, but, again, he relents because they love each other. this time, tevye tells golde the truth — and as a side effect, is prompted to re-evaluate their own arranged marriage and relationship. weeks later, when perchik is arrested in kiev and is exiled to siberia, hodel decides to join him there. she promises tevye that she and perchik will be married under a canopy there. not too long afterwards, tzeitel and motel become parents, and motel finally buys the sewing machine for which he has long scrimped and saved. by now they are becoming, in their own right, respected members of the community, and a close, almost father-son relationship is developing between motel and tevye — who, not so long ago, had scorned motel as a nobody. meanwhile, tevye's third daughter, chava , has fallen in love with a young russian — a russian orthodox christian — man, fyedka ([[ray lovelock . she eventually works up the courage to ask tevye to allow her to marry him. horrified, tevye forbids her to see him again, but they elope and are married in a russian orthodox church. in a soliloquy reminiscent of those spoken by tevye concerning his other daughters but with a radically different conclusion, tevye concludes that he cannot accept chava marrying a non-jew, in effect abandoning the jewish faith, so he disowns her. finally, the jews of anatevka are notified that they have to leave the village or be forced out by the government; they have three days. tevye, his family and friends begin packing up to leave, heading for various parts of the united states and other places. chava and her husband, fyedka, come to tevye's house and tell her family that they are leaving too — unable to stay in a place that would force innocent people out. tevye shows signs of forgiving chava for marrying outside her faith by telling tzeitel to tell them, ""god be with them,"" pleasing his wife and daughters, who also tell them where they will be living in new york, united states. just before the closing credits, tevye spots the fiddler and motions to him to come along, symbolizing that even though he must leave his town, his traditions will always be with him. the film ends with the fiddler following tevye down the road, playing the ""tradition"" theme."

ron while preparing why ron stopped shooting. ron explains that he was once an outlaw, using his great skill to rob banks, and trains. his criminal career ended when the woman he loved was shot during a gunfight, and he vowed to never pick up a gun again, until that day. ron advises for men like him and yang, the best thing they could do for the ones they loved was stay as far away from them as possible, that they are like flowers while he and yang are sand. the day before battle, lynne comes to yang and asks to leave with him after the fight, and to think on it. later that night, yang comes to lynne's house. he gives her his own twin short swords, explaining these were to kill. yang tells her to come close. the day comes and the colonel arrives with scores of outlaws to charge the town.

riders come. in the ensuing dust and chaos, yang rapidly and stealthily disposes of the men. the outlaws are lured to the ferris wheel, where yang and the carnies ambush them. ron slides to safety on a cable, and the ferris wheel is blown up, killing many of the colonel's men. thinking it safe, the carnies come out from cover, only to be attacked by the numerous remaining outlaws. the colonel's

get away before the bloodshed between the outlaw cowboys and clan warriors starts. yang runs after lynne and must cut down several warriors before following her to the laundry shop. meanwhile, the

carrying her in a building, yelling at his men to make sure no one got in. the sad flutes pursue hotly, and are mostly fended off with a small machine gun, but the outlaws are unable to stop yang, as he brutally slices through them all. he comes in the room to find the colonel holding a gun to april's head, and leaps up to cut the barrel and bullet in half mid-firing. catching april from falling, yang steps aside to let lynne fight the colonel. after a tense battle, lynne manages to finally drive a sword into the colonel's back. yang and lynne exit the room to find saddest flute sitting across the carnage at the end of the hall. he tells yang that april is the enemy, and asks if he would ever tell april that yang killed her parents, her whole clan, and observes that yang ran away from his old life of killing to kill more. he says yang does not belong there. yangs claims he does, or did, and will not kill april. yang and saddest flute go to the desert in the sunset, and duel to the death. during, flashbacks show saddest flute training yang as an adult in pouring rain, drilling him through adolescence in the snow, and forcing child yang to kill the puppy he was given, declaring yang's biggest enemy would be his heart, and as an assassin, he must kill what he loves. in the present, yang wins the duel, cutting saddest flute's throat. lynne tells yang she knows she won't be coming with him, and tries to hand him april, but he refuses. he makes the baby laugh once more, and gives lynne a caring look. yang turns to the sunset, and ron tells him to 'keep walking, sandman.' ron narrates that the warrior never stopped walking, to put as much space between him and the little lady he loved as possible, showing april then lynne. the scene then shifts to the a snowy, glacial environment. opera plays from a small fish shack where a hooded man in a parka sits. another approaches and asks how much for a fish. the sitting man nimbly kills the other, knives falling out of his hands as he collapses. yang stands up and goes to his shack, where he takes the pendant he had been given by lynne, his sword disguised as a snowman's broom, and april's pacifier, and sets the hut on fire. walking out to the snow, a slew of clan warriors leap out of the snow, and yang unsheathes his sword as the scene fades."

324,"aeneas leads escaped survivors of the trojan war to new land in italy. based on virgil's the aeneid.  in general, the avenger is a demythologized and condensed retelling of the second half of the aeneid. it is also insular in its storytelling, making none of the references to hannibal or caesar found in the aeneid. the movie differs from virgil's poem in many ways, but retains the same essential structure of books vii - xii. in virgil's aeneid, the story begins with juno provoking a storm that drives aeneas' ships to the carthage shores. the avenger begins after aeneas has arrived in italy, skipping the well-known substories of aeneas' affair with dido and his journey through the underworld. both stories recount the trojan war. in the aeneid, it is told by aeneas in dido's court; in the avenger it is told through a flashback while viewing a fresco in king latino's court. in the aeneid, gods and goddesses play a critical role in developing the plot, whereas in the avenger, there is little to no mention of the gods. throughout the aeneid, aeneas's mother venus actively protects him and advances his cause, while jupiter's wife juno actively opposes him and raises difficulties for him. jupiter, neptune, apollo, mercury and a host mythical creatures all make appearances as well. the movie borrows scenes from the poem, but often places them in a different context or reinterprets them with details altered. for example, in book v of the aeneid, the crew lands in the sicilian port eryx and is greeted by king acestes where they engage in a series of ceremonial games. one such game involves an archery contest where the target is a dove tied to a pole. in the aeneid, aeneas presides over the games , but in the avenger, king latino presides over the games while aeneas competes in them. in the aeneid, the first arrow strikes the pole, the second cuts the cord to the dove, while the third, delivered quickly after the second, catches the freed dove and brings it to the ground, winning the contest. although the contest has now been won, acestes shoots his bow anyway, and his arrow catches fire in the sky followed by a thunderbolt, which is interpreted as a great omen. in the avenger, the contest called for archery on horseback, there were multiple doves tied, and only two contestants: turno and camilla. camilla takes the first shot and misses, then is knocked off track by turno, who takes the second shot and hits the dove. he is awarded a prize, but the allegation that he played unfair causes him to challenge the audience, whereupon aeneas accepts the challenge and frees two doves with consecutive arrow shots. throughout the aeneid, not only the actions of the gods, but fate itself determines the outcome of events. this difference is highlighted by the titles: the aeneid, as the genitive case, translates as aeneas', referencing aeneas' destiny to settle italy, giving rise to a new race that will found rome and rule the world. it is unclear from the story why the film is called the avenger, as aeneas could be avenging aggression against the trojans by turno, or avenging the death of trojans in the war with the greeks."

to see tomoki. tomoki confronts ikaros and nymph on what is happening, but nymph explains they cannot tell him anything for fear of tomoki learning that hiyori is not the only part of his reality that isn't real. tomoki collapses from the severe headache pain, so the two angeloids including astraea look after him. nymph picks up something on her radar, so the three go to investigate, and find hiyori. the reunion is cut short when, she is transformed into an angeloid and is ordered by the master of the synapse to kill the three. hiyori uses her ability of time manipulation to attack both sorami city and the angeloids, and easily overpowers the three. nymph determines the only way to stop hiyori is to kill her, though ikaros objects, but nymph reluctantly prepares to do so, until she is stopped by tomoki, who swears to save hiyori. the master of the synapse orders hiyori to kill tomoki, but eishiro arrives to help, while the three angeloids stall hiyori. they manage to destroy the structure that binds her, but it does not free her. nymph also realizes that the dimensional mechanism system that produces hiyori's time altering powers has reached the breaking point causing a process that will result in the area around hiyori, sorami city, to be blown away. unable to stop the process, ikaros traps hiyori within her aegis to contain the blast, but also traps herself in since she does not want hiyori to be alone in her final moments. tomoki however hang glides to them and is let into the aegis, where he is able to bring hiyori back to her senses. hiyori begs for them to get away as it won't be long before she self-destructs, so she uses her hacking abilities to dispel the aegis, and kisses tomoki before leaving. she thanks him and remembers how they met first met as children, and that it was because of him that she came to love sorami city. she notes that while her time on earth was short, she enjoyed her time with everyone and thanks her friends and tomoki, and reaffirms her love for him before being destroyed. tomoki breaks down in tears, and the film ends with him swearing that he will never forget hiyori. near the end of the credits, sohara is seen viewing the scrapbook, filled with pictures of the group having fun. as sohara leaves, a picture where hiyori had faded away due to the synapse's deletion, is seen where hiyori slowly fades back in, revealing that she has somehow been revived. in a post-credits scene, tomoki stands at the spot overlooking the city where he and hiyori first met, and behind him a ray of light shines down with feathers falling from the sky, when he looks he smiles happily, and as the screen fades out, the sound of hiyori's bell ornaments are heard, also, implying she was somehow revived."
